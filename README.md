# Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Marcin Grabowy**, mostly knowns as *@FoXcodeZ*, a software developer from Poland.</br>
At present ***looking for*** an interesting ***remote job***.

 I'm learning *Python* right now.
## My tech-stack:
- C++, C#, CMake, clang, GCC, Git, Github
- Visual Studio, VS Code, CLion, Unity.

I'm passionate about game engines,  graphics programming, and all the low-level stuff around it.
